Week 1 programming assignment quiz answers

Quiz answers and explanations
Correct answers are in bold. Incorrect answers are shown in italics.

1. Consider the following line of code:

map1 = new UnfoldingMap(this, 50, 50, 350, 500, new Google.GoogleMapProvider()); 

What is the y-coordinate which corresponds to the pixel at the lower left corner of the map that is created by the line of code above? 

Remember that the axis (0,0) for pixels is in the upper left corner of the screen and higher y values appear lower on the screen. (This is unlike Cartesian coordinates where higher y values appear higher than the axis (0,0).)  

-> 50 - 50 is the x and y coordinate of the upper left corner of the map.  Remember, positive y points down.

-> 400 - 400 is the x coordinate of the right side of the map

-> 350 - 350 is the width of the map

-> 500 - 500 is the height of the map.  Again, remember that positive y points down.

-> 550 (correct) - 550 is the y coordinate of the lower left corner.  The y value starts at 50, you add a height of 500, and you end at 550.  



2. Which of the following lines of code will create two maps of the same height next to each other, side-by-side in the window.

Option 1:
map1 = new UnfoldingMap(50, 50, 200, 300);
map2 = new UnfoldingMap(50, 50, 250, 300);

This will create two maps at the same x, and y position, so the maps will be on top of each other.

Option 2: 
map1 = new UnfoldingMap(50, 50, 200, 300);
map2 = new UnfoldingMap(250, 350, 200, 300);
For this option, map2's upper left coordinate is (250, 350), which is offset in both the x and the y direction, so the map2 will be next to and below map1, diagonally.  

Option 3 (correct)
map1 = new UnfoldingMap(50, 50, 200, 300);
map2 = new UnfoldingMap(250, 50, 200, 300);
For this option, map2's upper left coordinate is (250, 50), while map1's upper left coordinate is (50, 50). So map2 will be to the right of map1, but at the same height. 

3. Assume you have some code that creates two maps that are supposed to be displayed side by side in an Applet window. Your code compiles and runs, but only one map shows up in the visible portion of the Applet window when you run it. Which of the following bugs might explain why? SELECT ALL the possible mistakes that could be causing this problem.
-> Forgetting to call map2.draw() (correct).  If you do not call map2.draw(), Java will not display the map.

-> Placing the map2 outside the coordinates of the window (correct).  It is possible to specify coordinates so that the map is drawn completely outside the window and the user won't be able to see it.

-> Forgetting to call zoomAndPanTo on map2.  If you do not call zoomAndPanTo, the map will still display, but at a default location and zoom level.

4.  Which of the following latitude, longitude pairs, when passed to the method zoomAndPanTo, would cause the map to be centered on Rio de Janeiro, Brazil?
-> -22.9, -43.2 (correct).  Southern latitudes and Western longitudes are represented with negative numbers.
